# Setting up the stack for this blog

1. Get Ruby. I followed the instructions in [Moncef Belyamani's guide](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/the-definitive-guide-to-installing-ruby-gems-on-a-mac/), which use `chruby` and `ruby-install` as the Ruby manager.
1. Get Jekyll. Instructions are available on the [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
1. Get the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes?tab=readme-ov-file). Install according to the [documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).
1. Set up Minimal Mistakes as a remote theme.
1. Install the required gems.
1. Refer to the Minimal Mistakes GitHub for sample files.
1. To generate the site locally, you must use `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
