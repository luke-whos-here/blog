# Setting up this blog

1. Get Ruby. I followed the instructions in [Moncef Belyamani's guide](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/the-definitive-guide-to-installing-ruby-gems-on-a-mac/), which use `chruby` and `ruby-install` as the Ruby manager.
1. Get Jekyll. Instructions are available on the [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
