<p>Of late, “lean” seems to be making a comeback as a top pick among corporate buzzwords.</p>

<p>I suspect more than a few of you likely to be reading this post have, in recent months, attended meetings best described as leantastic. Like you, I’ve discharged my duties at these events with honour and professionalism. I’ve spectated with rapt attention the “lean in”, nodded excitedly at the “lean forward”, applauded in elation the “lean toward”.</p>

<p>But there is a deeper, older, more primordial part of my brain. The part that knows what the staff-only area of a McDonald’s looks like.</p>

<p>And it’s calling out. “GOT TIME TO LEAN, GOT TIME TO CLEAN.”</p>
